                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... <strong>Just kidding!</strong></p>
                <p>Unpack in the <em>modules</em> folder (currently in the root of your Drupal 8 installation) and enable in <strong>/admin/modules</strong>.</p>
                <p>Then, visit <strong>/admin/config/development/loremipsum</strong> and enter your own set of phrases to build random-generated text (or go with the default Lorem ipsum).</p>
                <p>Last, visit <strong>www.example.com/loremipsum/generate/P/S</strong> where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>P</em> is the number of <em>paragraphs</em></li>
                    <li><em>S</em> is the maximum number of <em>sentences</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is also a generator block in which you can choose how many paragraphs and phrases and it\'ll do the rest.</p>
                <p>If you need, there\'s also a specific <em>generate lorem ipsum</em> permission.</p>
                <h3>Attention</h3>
                <p>Most bugs have been ironed out, holes covered, features added. But this module is a work in progress. Please report bugs and suggestions, ok?</p>
